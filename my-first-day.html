        <p>This is to introduce what I'm doing:</p>
<p>I have committed to a New Year's Resolution that I will loose at least 10kg this year. I actually want this to be a reality, because, of course, being thin is great, you are better looking, you feel better and more confident and you don't have to carry around all that redundant weight, which is just a bother.</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, I want to record here what I have eaten and done in exercise to know what I've done to get back into shape. Also, this might help vent the craving etc that I go through while minimising the amount of sugar and carbs intake.</p>
<p>OK, day 1:</p>
<p>Today I've come back from a visit to my friends in a city a few hours away. We had a great time and for breakfast/brunch I had a protein based meal with avocado, salmon, 2 eggs, 2 mushrooms and some greens. I also had a flat white coffee and a mango smoothy, I guess one shouldn't start out too radically ;-).</p>
<p>Then, for dinner, I had a smallish portion of lasagne and a muffin, again some sugar, but for it being everything today, that's not too bad. I also had a beer.</p>
<p>Later, I got hungry and craved for something sweet and had a banana and a few cherries.</p>
<p>So, over all, not a perfect day, but I did feel good for not over-eating.</p>
